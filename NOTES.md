### Idea for Project:
* Create a page application that will allow students to keep record of their homework assignments. Students can add assignments with the following information: Class Subject, Homework Title, Due Date and Homework Instructions. 

### What should the app do:
* A student can fill out a form to keep records of homework assignments for the students classes. The student can also delete the assignments when the work is completed. Testin this.

* Make a get request to the endpoint URL to get an array and for each of those objects are shown on the DOM.
* Have 3 event listeners.
* Need an array iteration(after GET request)
